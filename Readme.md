# Kalimba Color Theme

*by Riley Haefner <<riley.allison.h@gmail.com>>*

An airy VS Code color theme that is easy on the eyes with balanced pastel accents.

Note: This color theme is viewed best in combination with the [Kalimba Icon Theme](https://github.com/rybb13/kalimba-icon-theme-vsce). You can use the [Kalimba Themes](https://github.com/rybb13/kalimba-themes-vsce-pack) extension pack to install both at once.
